About:
This website is a personal website project for IAT 355 - Introduction to Visual Analytics. It contains information about me including a
brief bio, my education, experience, and contact. It also contains a page of visualizations using SVG. 

Technologies:
The site was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Navigation: 
The site can be navigated by starting on the home page/about me page. This page has a navigation bar on top that contains links to the current page and the visualizations page. This navigation bar is also present on the visualizations page. The visualizations page features a bar graph, and a interactive piece that lets you push circles around and change their color (interactivity done through JavaScript).
