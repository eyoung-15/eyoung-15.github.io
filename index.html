        <p>Hey, my name is Emily Youngward! I am a fourth year Simon Fraser University student in the BSc Interactive
            Arts and Technology program. My
            interests lie
            in designing and developing for the web and mobile. I am currently working to fulfill the “Design and
            Development for Web and Mobile” concentration for my degree.

            <h4> Arcana Journal Application
            </h4>
            <p>In this project I worked in a team of two to create a functioning mobile application using
                React Native. Our project was a mood logging application. Everytime a user tracked their mood
                they were awarded a collectable tarot card associated with that mood. The application also
                made use of camera features and location/weather services to attach to your mood log.

            <h4> HighTail Matches Company Website
            </h4>
            <p>In this project I worked in a team of two to design and develop a website for a fake
                company. Our company was called HighTail Matches. Our website contained a home page, "about us" page,
                products page,
                cart page etc. The website included the process of what it would be like to go through purchasing
                a product from our company online.
