        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, my name is Emily! I’m from Calgary, AB but currently located in Burnaby, BC. I
            am a fourth year Simon Fraser University student in the BSc Interactive Arts and Technology program. My
            interests lie
            in designing and developing for the web and mobile. I am currently working to fulfill the “Design and
            Development for Web and Mobile” concentration for my degree. I have skills in Figma, HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript,
            and React Native.
